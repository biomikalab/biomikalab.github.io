# Lab Missions

Our missions are:
- Providing research and consultation services for genomic data analysis. Currently we have softwares and infrastructures to analyse genomics, metagenomics, environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, transcriptomics, and metatranscriptomics.
- Research and development of bioinformatics algorithms, softwares, and databases.
- Providing education and training programs for human resources development in various bioinformatic skills, by workshops, training programs, internships, and student final project supervising. 

# Research Program

Our primary research expertise is on analyzing and integrating omics data to answer question biologically relevant questions on the fields of genomics and the environment.

# The Team

The research group is formed by a talented group of international scientists at different levels of their careers with a common interest on applying computational methods to understand biology. Know more about them on the [People’s page](https://biomikalab.github.io/people/).
